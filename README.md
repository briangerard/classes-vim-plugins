# Quick Vundle Setup

For a sandboxed demo, it should just be...

```sh
git clone https://github.com/briangerard/vundle-and-vim-plugins-demo.git
cd vundle-and-vim-plugins-demo
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
# ...from within the VM....
cd /vagrant
./initialize
```

But this should also be safe to run on your own environment.
